The following is a history of the contributions others have made to the development of 
Language of Languages (LoLs).

Language of Languages (LoLs) began as a proof of concept demonstration developed first in 
Smalltalk using Squeak and then migrated to Pharo. The current web implementation forked
OMeta-JS to bootstrap and develop the LoLs language workbench.
