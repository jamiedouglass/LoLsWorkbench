Language of Languages (LoLs) is a language workbench for quickly and easily implementing 
Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to gain the 10x productivity improvement DSLs promise. 
LoLs creates interpreters and translators to other languages and integrates languages 
with different notations. 

This open source project provides a minimal working language workbench. 
This version supports textual languages and enough functionality to develop 
future releases. We are creating a Language Workbench and Server which 
operates with a client-server architecture as a Website and server. There is nothing 
to download or install. 

Most of the workbench features and functionality are yet to be implemented. 
Please join us to make Language of Languages available to everyone.

Overview
--------

Language of Languages (LoLs) is being bootstrapped and written in itself. This includes 
the parser and metalanguage. LoLs compiles into JavaScript and directly executed. Work is
divided into workspace files. Each workspace consists of interrelated views and languages.

Project Organization
--------------------
Language of Languages is organized as following:
* LoLsWorkbench repository contains the website to open and edit a workspace to create and modify a language. This includes using languages to translate source input into object output.
* LoLsServer repository contains the Node.js server which processes languages to perform translations.
* LoLsOMetaJS repository contains the initial metalanguage used in Language of Languages.

Using Language of languages (LoLs) Workbench

LoLs is accessible for the workbench link on the Language of Languages (LoLs) website
[www.languageoflanguages.com/LoLsWorkbench/](http://www.languageoflanguages.com/LoLsWorkbench/).
Workspace files can be loaded and saved to your computer.
