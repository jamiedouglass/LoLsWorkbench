Language of Languages (LoLs) is a language workbench for quickly and easily implementing 
Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) to gain the 10x productivity improvement DSLs promise. 
LoLs creates interpreters and translators to other languages and integrates languages 
with different notations. 

The initial release of this open source project provides a minimal working language 
workbench. This version supports textual languages and enough functionality to develop 
future releases. We are creating a Software as a Service Language Workbench which 
operates only on the client side. Nothing to download or install. All your information 
remains on your computer.

Most of the workbench features and functionality are yet to be implemented. 
Please join us to make Language of Languages available to everyone.
